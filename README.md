Sitar
=====

Sitar (__S__WT GU__ITAR__) is an automated testing framework for [SWT](http://eclipse.org/swt) applications. 
It consists of a set of plugins for [GUITAR](http://guitar.sourceforge.net) to adapt GUITAR-Core for use with SWT.

About GUITAR
------------

GUITAR is a model-based system for automated GUI testing. GUITAR comes with support for Swing, and a number of plugins 
for different graphical toolkits have also been written. Sitar is the official adapter for SWT. 

More information about GUITAR can be found on its 
[website](http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/guitar/index.php?title=GUITAR_Home_Page).

History
-------

GUITAR is primarily a research project of the University of Maryland's 
[Event Driven Software Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/edsl). Many students have worked on the code, but the project 
was primarily envisioned and designed by [Prof. Atif Memon](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif). 

A team of researchers at the University of Illinois did the initial work implementing a collection of plugins for GUITAR 
to work with SWT applications. Their prototype could rip some static SWT applications, although it lacked a replayer and 
many other critical features. 

As part of Prof. Memon's [Spring 2011 Software Engineering course](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~atif/Teaching/Spring2011), I 
(Gabe Gorelick) led a team of undergraduates on a semester-long project to bring SWTGuitar (as it was then called) up to 
feature parity with Swing GUITAR. Sitar is the result of this work.
